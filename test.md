# Test Page

This is a simple test page to verify that the Jekyll build is working correctly.

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Vision Transformer world!")
```

## Math Example

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
