<h2 id="introduction-to-transformers">Introduction to Transformers</h2>

<p>Transformers have revolutionized the field of deep learning since their introduction in the 2017 paper “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. Originally designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, transformers have since been adapted for computer vision applications with remarkable success. This section covers the foundational theory of transformers, with a focus on their application to computer vision tasks.</p>

<p>The transformer architecture represents a paradigm shift in deep learning, moving away from recurrent and convolutional architectures toward a design that relies entirely on attention mechanisms. This shift has enabled models to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and process data in parallel, leading to significant improvements in performance across various tasks.</p>

<h2 id="the-attention-mechanism-the-core-of-transformers">The Attention Mechanism: The Core of Transformers</h2>

<h3 id="self-attention-explained">Self-Attention Explained</h3>

<p>The key innovation in transformer models is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which process data sequentially or locally, self-attention can directly model relationships between all positions in a sequence.</p>

<p>In the context of transformers, attention mechanisms serve to weigh the influence of different input tokens when producing an output. The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of all tokens in a sequence, where the weights are determined by the compatibility between the query and key representations of the tokens.</p>

<p>To understand self-attention more intuitively, consider how humans read text. When we encounter a pronoun like “it,” we naturally look back at the text to determine what “it” refers to. Similarly, self-attention allows a model to “look” at all other positions in the input to better understand the context of each position. This ability to consider the entire context simultaneously is what gives transformers their power.</p>

<em>Figure 2: Self-Attention Mechanism showing how Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors are derived from input embeddings and interact to produce weighted outputs. The Query represents “what we’re looking for,” the Key represents “what we have,” and the Value represents “what we’ll return if there’s a match.”</em></p>

<h3 id="scaled-dot-product-attention">Scaled Dot-Product Attention</h3>

<p>The transformer implements a scaled dot-product attention, which follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For each position in the input sequence, create three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V)</li>
  <li>Calculate attention scores by taking the dot product of the query with all keys</li>
  <li>Scale the scores by dividing by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors</li>
  <li>Apply a softmax function to obtain the weights</li>
  <li>Multiply each value vector by its corresponding weight and sum them to produce the output</li>
</ol>

<p>Mathematically, this is represented as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) · V
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Q, K, and V are matrices containing the queries, keys, and values</li>
  <li>d_k is the dimension of the key vectors</li>
  <li>The scaling factor √d_k prevents the softmax function from having extremely small gradients</li>
</ul>

<p>The scaling factor is crucial because as the dimension of the key vectors increases, the dot products can grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients. This scaling helps maintain stable gradients during training, allowing the model to learn more effectively.</p>

<h3 id="multi-head-attention">Multi-Head Attention</h3>

<p>To enhance the model’s ability to focus on different positions and representation subspaces, transformers use multi-head attention. This involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Linearly projecting the queries, keys, and values multiple times with different learned projections</li>
  <li>Performing the attention function in parallel on each projection</li>
  <li>Concatenating the results and projecting again</li>
</ol>

<p>This allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, providing a richer understanding of the input data.</p>

<p>Multi-head attention can be thought of as having multiple “representation subspaces” or “attention heads,” each focusing on different aspects of the input. For example, in language processing, one head might focus on syntactic relationships, while another might focus on semantic relationships. By combining these different perspectives, the model gains a more comprehensive understanding of the data.</p>

<p>And W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V, and W^O are learned parameter matrices.</p>

<h2 id="transformer-architecture">Transformer Architecture</h2>

<h3 id="overall-structure">Overall Structure</h3>

<p>A transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple identical layers. Each layer has two main components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A multi-head self-attention mechanism</li>
  <li>A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, each sublayer employs residual connections and layer normalization to facilitate training.</p>

<p>The transformer architecture is designed to be highly parallelizable, allowing for efficient training on modern hardware. Unlike RNNs, which process tokens sequentially, transformers can process all tokens in parallel, significantly reducing training time for large datasets.</p>

<h3 id="the-encoder">The Encoder</h3>

<p>The encoder processes the input sequence and generates representations that capture the contextual relationships within the data. Each encoder layer consists of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Multi-head self-attention layer: Allows each position to attend to all positions in the previous layer</li>
  <li>Feed-forward neural network: Applied to each position separately and identically</li>
  <li>Layer normalization and residual connections: Stabilize and accelerate training</li>
</ol>

<p>The encoder’s self-attention mechanism allows it to create contextual representations of each input token, taking into account the entire input sequence. This is particularly valuable for tasks where understanding the relationships between different parts of the input is crucial.</p>

<h3 id="the-decoder">The Decoder</h3>

<p>The decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time. Each decoder layer includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Masked multi-head self-attention: Prevents positions from attending to subsequent positions</li>
  <li>Multi-head attention over the encoder output: Allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence</li>
  <li>Feed-forward neural network</li>
  <li>Layer normalization and residual connections</li>
</ol>

<p>The decoder’s masked self-attention is a key innovation that enables autoregressive generation. By masking future positions during training, the model learns to predict the next token based only on previously generated tokens, which is essential for tasks like machine translation or text generation.</p>

<p>The second attention layer in the decoder, which attends to the encoder’s output, creates a bridge between the input and output sequences. This allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating each output token.</p>

<h3 id="positional-encoding">Positional Encoding</h3>

<p>Since transformers do not inherently process sequential information, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence. These encodings have the same dimension as the embeddings, allowing them to be summed.</p>

<p>The original transformer paper used sine and cosine functions of different frequencies to create these positional encodings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pos is the position</li>
  <li>i is the dimension</li>
  <li>d_model is the embedding dimension</li>
</ul>

<p>These encodings have the useful property that for any fixed offset k, PE(pos+k) can be represented as a linear function of PE(pos), which helps the model learn relative positions more easily.</p>

<p>Positional encodings are crucial for transformers because, unlike RNNs or CNNs, the self-attention operation is permutation-invariant—it doesn’t inherently know the order of the input sequence. By adding positional information to the token embeddings, the model can distinguish between tokens at different positions and understand the sequential nature of the data.</p>

<h2 id="from-nlp-to-computer-vision-vision-transformers-vit">From NLP to Computer Vision: Vision Transformers (ViT)</h2>

<h3 id="adapting-transformers-for-images">Adapting Transformers for Images</h3>

<p>Vision Transformers (ViT) adapt the transformer architecture for image processing tasks. The key insight is to treat an image as a sequence of patches, similar to how words are treated in NLP applications.</p>

<p>The process involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Splitting the image into fixed-size patches (typically 16×16 pixels)</li>
  <li>Flattening each patch into a vector</li>
  <li>Linearly projecting these vectors to obtain patch embeddings</li>
  <li>Adding positional embeddings to retain spatial information</li>
  <li>Processing the resulting sequence with a standard transformer encoder</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach represents a significant departure from the convolutional architectures that have dominated computer vision for decades. Instead of gradually building up feature representations through a hierarchy of convolutional layers, ViT processes the entire image globally from the first layer.</p>

<em>Figure 4: Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture showing how an image is divided into patches, which are then linearly embedded and processed by a transformer encoder. The class token (CLS) is used for image classification tasks.</em></p>

<h3 id="vit-architecture-details">ViT Architecture Details</h3>

<p>The Vision Transformer architecture includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Patch Embedding</strong>: Images are divided into patches, which are linearly embedded. This is analogous to the word embeddings in NLP transformers. For a typical implementation with 16×16 pixel patches on a 224×224 image, this results in 196 patches, each represented as a high-dimensional vector.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Class Token</strong>: A learnable embedding is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches (similar to BERT’s [CLS] token). This token aggregates information from the entire image and is used for classification tasks. After passing through the transformer encoder, the representation of this token is fed into a classification head to predict the image class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Positional Embedding</strong>: Added to the patch embeddings to retain spatial information. Unlike in NLP, where positions are one-dimensional, image patches have a two-dimensional arrangement. However, ViT typically uses a simple learnable 1D positional embedding, which works surprisingly well despite not explicitly encoding the 2D structure of images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transformer Encoder</strong>: Standard transformer encoder blocks process the sequence. Each block consists of multi-head self-attention followed by a feed-forward network, with layer normalization and residual connections. The self-attention mechanism allows each patch to attend to all other patches, enabling the model to capture global relationships across the entire image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MLP Head</strong>: A classification head is attached to the output of the [CLS] token for image classification tasks. This typically consists of a simple multi-layer perceptron that maps the final representation of the class token to the output classes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-differences-from-cnns">Key Differences from CNNs</h3>

<p>Vision Transformers differ from traditional CNNs in several important ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Global Processing</strong>: ViTs process the entire image globally from the first layer, whereas CNNs build global context gradually through hierarchical processing. This allows ViTs to capture long-range dependencies more directly, which can be advantageous for tasks that require understanding relationships between distant parts of an image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inductive Bias</strong>: CNNs have strong inductive biases (locality, translation equivariance), while ViTs have minimal image-specific inductive biases. CNNs assume that nearby pixels are more related than distant ones and that patterns can appear anywhere in the image. ViTs make fewer assumptions about the structure of images, which can be both a strength and a weakness—they’re more flexible but may require more data to learn these patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Positional Information</strong>: CNNs implicitly encode spatial relationships, while ViTs must learn these relationships through positional embeddings. The convolutional operation naturally preserves spatial information, whereas transformers must be explicitly told about the spatial arrangement of patches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: ViTs can be more computationally efficient for certain tasks, especially when pre-trained on large datasets. The self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of patches, which can be a limitation for high-resolution images. However, various optimizations and hybrid approaches have been developed to address this issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data Requirements</strong>: ViTs typically require more training data than CNNs to achieve comparable performance when trained from scratch. This is because they lack the strong inductive biases of CNNs and must learn these patterns from data. However, when pre-trained on large datasets, ViTs can outperform CNNs on many tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="advanced-transformer-variants-for-computer-vision">Advanced Transformer Variants for Computer Vision</h2>

<h3 id="swin-transformer">Swin Transformer</h3>

<p>The Swin (Shifted Window) Transformer introduces hierarchical feature maps and shifted windowing to improve efficiency and performance. Key innovations include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hierarchical Feature Maps</strong>: Merging patches progressively to create a hierarchical representation. This is similar to the feature pyramid in CNNs and allows the model to capture multi-scale features efficiently. At each stage, neighboring patches are merged, reducing the sequence length while increasing the feature dimension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Window-based Self-Attention</strong>: Computing self-attention within local windows to reduce computational complexity. Instead of performing self-attention across the entire image, which scales quadratically with image size, Swin Transformer restricts attention to local windows. This reduces the computational complexity to linear with respect to image size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shifted Window Partitioning</strong>: Alternating between regular and shifted window partitioning to enable cross-window connections. In one layer, the image is divided into non-overlapping windows; in the next layer, the window partitioning is shifted, creating connections between previously separate windows. This allows information to flow across the entire image while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Swin Transformer’s hierarchical design and efficient attention mechanism make it particularly well-suited for dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, where multi-scale feature representations are important.</p>

<h3 id="deit-data-efficient-image-transformers">DeiT (Data-efficient image Transformers)</h3>

<p>DeiT demonstrates that Vision Transformers can be trained effectively on smaller datasets through:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Distillation Token</strong>: A specific token that learns from a teacher model (typically a CNN). In addition to the class token, DeiT introduces a distillation token that is supervised by the output of a pre-trained CNN. This allows the model to leverage the inductive biases of CNNs without explicitly incorporating them into the architecture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strong Data Augmentation</strong>: Techniques like RandAugment and CutMix to increase data diversity. These augmentations create a more varied training set, helping the model generalize better from limited data. RandAugment applies a series of random transformations to each image, while CutMix combines patches from different images along with their labels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Regularization</strong>: Methods to prevent overfitting on smaller datasets. DeiT employs techniques like stochastic depth (randomly dropping layers during training) and weight decay to improve generalization.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>DeiT’s approach shows that with appropriate training techniques, transformers can achieve competitive performance even without the massive pre-training datasets used in the original ViT paper.</p>

<h3 id="mobilevit">MobileViT</h3>

<p>MobileViT combines the strengths of CNNs and transformers for mobile applications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Local Processing</strong>: Using convolutions for local feature extraction. MobileViT starts with convolutional layers to efficiently capture local patterns and reduce the spatial dimensions of the input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Global Understanding</strong>: Applying transformers for global context modeling. After the initial convolutional processing, transformer blocks are used to capture long-range dependencies and global context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lightweight Design</strong>: Optimized architecture for mobile devices with limited computational resources. MobileViT uses depth-wise separable convolutions and efficient transformer implementations to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both architectures—the efficiency and local processing capabilities of CNNs, and the global modeling capabilities of transformers—making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<h2 id="attention-mechanisms-beyond-transformers">Attention Mechanisms Beyond Transformers</h2>

<h3 id="non-local-neural-networks">Non-local Neural Networks</h3>

<p>Non-local neural networks capture long-range dependencies by computing the response at a position as a weighted sum of features at all positions. This is conceptually similar to self-attention but was developed independently.</p>

<p>The non-local operation can be expressed as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>y_i = 1/C(x) ∑_j f(x_i, x_j) g(x_j)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>x_i is the input feature at position i</li>
  <li>y_i is the output feature at position i</li>
  <li>f(x_i, x_j) computes a scalar representing the relationship between positions i and j</li>
  <li>g(x_j) computes a representation of the input at position j</li>
  <li>C(x) is a normalization factor</li>
</ul>

<p>This operation allows the model to consider all positions when computing the output for each position, capturing global context. Non-local neural networks have been successfully applied to video understanding, where capturing temporal dependencies is crucial.</p>

<h3 id="squeeze-and-excitation-networks">Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks</h3>

<p>Squeeze-and-Excitation networks adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modeling interdependencies between channels, providing a form of attention over feature channels.</p>

<p>The SE block consists of two operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Squeeze</strong>: Global average pooling to extract channel-wise statistics</li>
  <li><strong>Excitation</strong>: A gating mechanism with two fully connected layers and a sigmoid activation to generate channel-wise attention weights</li>
</ol>

<p>Mathematically, for input feature map U:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>z = F_sq(U) = GlobalAveragePooling(U)
s = F_ex(z) = σ(W_2 · ReLU(W_1 · z))
Û = s · U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>z is the squeezed representation</li>
  <li>s is the channel-wise attention weights</li>
  <li>Û is the recalibrated feature map</li>
  <li>W_1 and W_2 are learnable parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>SE networks improve performance by allowing the model to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, with minimal additional computational cost.</p>

<h3 id="cbam-convolutional-block-attention-module">CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module)</h3>

<p>CBAM combines channel and spatial attention to enhance the representational power of CNNs, focusing on “what” and “where” to attend in the feature maps.</p>

<p>CBAM consists of two sequential sub-modules:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Channel Attention Module</strong>: Similar to SE networks, it focuses on “what” is meaningful in the input features</li>
  <li><strong>Spatial Attention Module</strong>: Focuses on “where” to attend by generating a spatial attention map</li>
</ol>

<p>The process can be summarized as:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>F' = M_c(F) ⊗ F
F'' = M_s(F') ⊗ F'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>F is the input feature map</li>
  <li>M_c is the channel attention map</li>
  <li>M_s is the spatial attention map</li>
  <li>⊗ represents element-wise multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p>CBAM provides a complementary attention mechanism to the self-attention used in transformers, focusing on different aspects of the input data.</p>
