# Comprehensive Guide to Transformers for Computer Vision Engineers

This comprehensive guide is designed for data scientists specializing in Computer Vision who want to learn about Transformer architectures. The content covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with a focus on Vision Transformers (ViT) and related models.

## What You'll Learn

-   **Theoretical understanding** of transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
-   **Overview of transformer applications** in Computer Vision
-   **Detailed setup instructions** for different hardware environments (including options for laptops without GPUs)
-   **Hands-on practice exercises** with step-by-step solutions
-   **References** to further resources and research papers

All hands-on exercises are compatible with Google Colab, making them accessible even without dedicated GPU hardware.
